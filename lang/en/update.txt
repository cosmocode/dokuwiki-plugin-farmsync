You can either enter a specific page, or a namespace. For a namespace ending with '':**'' means that all pages in this namespace and in all subnamespaces will be copied. Whereas ending in just '':*'' means that only pages which are directly in this namespace will be copied, pages in subnamespaces willl be skipped.

Media files are handled analogous.
